This is an opinionated boilerplate/starterkit/scaffold to get up and running with smart contract & dApp development in the substrate-ecosystem.

It also comes in handy for hackathons. üëÄ

## Disclaimer üö®

This repository is still work-in-progress and there are many things that need to be improved.

## The Stack

- Package-Manager: `pnpm`
- Smart Contract Development: `ink!`, `cargo`
- Frontend: `next`
  - Contract Interactions: `polkadot-js`
  - Styling: `chakra`, `tailwindcss`, `twin.macro`, `emotion`
- Misc:
  - Linting & Formatting: `eslint`, `prettier`, `husky`, `lint-staged`

## Projects using it

Below you find a few projects that use this boilerplate, a variation of it, or have a similar setup setup that inspired it:

- [Azero Domains](https://github.com/wottpal/azero.domains) ‚Äì Domain Nameservice for Aleph Zero (Hackathon)

## Getting Started

### Frontend

```bash
# 1. Install pnpm (https://pnpm.io/installation)
npm i -g pnpm

# 2. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 3. Copy & fill environments
# NOTE: Documentation of environment variables can be found in the according `.example` file
cp packages/frontend/.env.local.example packages/frontend/.env.local
```

### Contracts

```bash
# 1. Install Rust & Cargo: https://docs.substrate.io/install/
# NOTE: Leave out the "Compile a Substrate node" part for now

# 2. Install ink! CLI tooling (https://use.ink/getting-started/setup#ink-cli)
cargo install cargo-dylint dylint-link
cargo install cargo-contract --force --locked

# 3. Optional: Install local substrate-contracts-node (https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node)
# NOTE: Fixed to latest release tag working with contracts-ui & cargo-contracts (v0.21.0)
cargo install contracts-node --git https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node.git --tag v0.21.0
```

## Development

### Frontend Quickstart

```bash
# NOTE: Can be executed in both, the root-dir or in `packages/frontend/`

# Start Frontend (Next.js)
pnpm dev
```

### Contracts Quickstart

```bash
# NOTE: Can only be executed in `packages/contracts`
# NOTE¬≤: I created shorthand npm-scripts. The full commands can be found in `package.json`.
cd packages/contracts

# Build Contracts
pnpm build

# Start local Substrate node (https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node)
pnpm node

# Start local node, open contracts-ui, and polkadot.js-explorer
# NOTE: When using Brave, shields have to be taken down for the UIs
pnpm dev

# Test Contracts
pnpm test
```

### VSCode Setup

#### Workspace

I strongly reommend developing in VSCode by opening the workspace file located at `.vscode/inkathon.code-workspace` instead of just the directory. This has multiple advantages and assures a more predictable monorepo configuration. The first plugin listed below will help with getting used to it.

#### Plugins

I strongly recommend installing all the plugins listed below. They should be suggested automatically by VSCode as they are contained in `.vscode/extensions.json`.

1. [`zoma.vscode-auto-open-workspace`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zoma.vscode-auto-open-workspace) ‚Äì Automatically suggests opening the according `.code-workspace` file.
2. [`dbaeumer.vscode-eslint`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) ‚Äì Adds ESLint editor support.
3. [`esbenp.prettier-vscode`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) ‚Äì Adds Prettier editor support.
4. [`bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) & [`lightyen.tailwindcss-intellisense-twin`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lightyen.tailwindcss-intellisense-twin) ‚Äì Adds tailwindcss & twin.macro editor support.
5. [`bungcip.better-toml`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bungcip.better-toml) ‚Äì Adds `.toml` file support.
6. [`rust-lang.rust-analyzer`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) ‚Äì Adds Rust language support.
7. Optional: [`gruntfuggly.todo-tree`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gruntfuggly.todo-tree) & [`wayou.vscode-todo-highlight`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wayou.vscode-todo-highlight) ‚Äì Lists all `TODO` comments in your workspace.
8. Optional: [`mikestead.dotenv`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mikestead.dotenv) ‚Äì Adds syntax highlighting for `.env` files.

#### Snippets

The file [`packages/frontend/.vscode/frontend.code-snippets`](https://github.com/scio-labs/inkathon/blob/main/packages/frontend/.vscode/frontend.code-snippets) contains useful snippets for quickly creating components & pages with Next.js, React, Typescript, and twin.macro. Example: Enter "Function Component with Props" in an empty `.tsx` file to get a `FC` component boilerplate with an empty TypeScript interface declaration and already imported 'twin.macro'. Check out the snippet-file itself to get a full overview.

## Deployment

Setting up a deployment via Vercel is pretty straightforward, only a few things have to be configured differently (as it's a monorepo structure):

1. Press the **Deploy** button below:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fscio-labs%2Finkathon%2F&env=NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCTION_MODE,NEXT_PUBLIC_URL,NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_ENDPOINT&envDescription=Environment%20Variables%20Documentation&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fscio-labs%2Finkathon%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fpackages%2Ffrontend%2F.env.local.example&redirect-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fscio-labs%2Finkathon%2F&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Finkathon.xyz)

2. Configure the environment variables (see [`packages/frontend/.env.local.example`](https://github.com/scio-labs/inkathon/blob/main/packages/frontend/.env.local.example) for documentation) and wait for the first build to finish.
3. Wait for the first build (which will fail) and overwrite the project settings as follows:

   - Set custom "Output Directory": `./packages/frontend/.next`
   - Optionally set custom "Install Command": `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile` to enforce a less strict behavior when lock-files are not in sync.

4. Redeploy (Press the three dots next to the latest deployment in Vercel)

## FAQs & Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>What is pnpm and do I really need it?</strong></summary>

[Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) works in my experience way faster and more reliable within monorepos than npm or yarn. When using it though, it's strongly recommended everyone in the team uses it. No installs should perform be performed nor any other lockfiles should be commited.

<details>
<summary><strong>How to approach styling?</strong></summary>

This boilerplate currently offers styling via the following options.

- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) ‚Äì Component library for quick prototyping e.g. during hackathons)
- [twin.macro](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro) ‚Äì [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) within Styled Components via [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled) (see [snippets](#snippets))
- Standard (S)CSS styles via `className` and `*.module.(s)css` files.

Important, in production it's recommended to use at most one of 1. and 2. to reduce bundle size.

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I just use plain TailwindCSS?</strong></summary>

The packages above can be easily switched out with plain TailwindCSS, a detailed guide on that is coming very soon. In the meantime, open an issue to get guidance.
